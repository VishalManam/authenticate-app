Registration System for Authenticated Users:
  Purpose of this Project: This project can be used by any organization which finds the need of a Login and Registration form along with the Email Validation option. Every input field and its title can be changed. The benefits of having a professional registration system are:
    •	With a complete registration system, you not only get sign-ups and participant information in a collective and neat portal, but you also get the opportunity to follow up the participants throughout the process. If the registration system offers participant administration, you can follow up on the participants’ status (registered, cancelled, waitlisted, etc.), be able to see who has/has not paid, register attendance and perform all administrative work related to the participants in the same system.
    •	A supplier of a good online registration system allows you to design and customize a clear calendar with conversion-optimal registration forms on your own website. Customize both the course calendar and the registration form, so that it gets the look and feel you want in order to attract participants.
    •	A well-structured registration system allows you to send email marketing to existing and past participants. Make sure participants stay in your customer-base and purchase courses over and over, by keeping them updated through a regular email marketing scheme. Send out notices when you set up new trainings and keep track of how many people open the email and sign up.
    •	A survey carried out by Spinweb showed that over 90% prefer to register online. This should be a provoking thought for the training providers who do not yet have a registration system that allows registrations from their own website. Providing potential participants with a simple and preferred way of registering can be what is needed to increase the number of registrations.
    •	As mentioned earlier, over 90% prefer to register online. Making it easy to register for courses is an important part of providing good customer service. In addition, a registration solution will ensure that you get all the necessary information to be able to answer inquiries immediately. Quick response to inquiries increases experienced customer service.
    •	Participants are given the opportunity to be informed directly in their own inbox when a new training of interest has been launched, without having to search for information about it themselves.
  
  Types of Users:
  1.	Admin: An Admin is the one who monitors the data of the users. A Database Administrator must ensure that the data remains consistent across the database, data is clearly defined and there is provision for data security and recovery control. The Admin has access to information of the users and if in any case when the users cannot access their account or if the users cannot be changing their personal data, the admin can update the data according to the user. As a database administrator, you'll need to:
    a.	establish the needs of users and monitor user access and security.
    b.	monitor performance and manage parameters to provide fast responses to front-end users
    c.	further refining the physical design to meet system storage requirements
    d.	install and test new versions of the database management system (DBMS)
    e.	maintain data standards, including adherence to the Data Protection Act

  2.	Verified User: When a person registers himself, a mail will be sent to his Mail ID for security reasons. He will be recognized as a verified user only when he verifies his E-mail. He would then be logging into his profile for other tasks. A non-verified user cannot access his private portal with verifying his Mail. The various features available to a Verified User are:
    a.	If the verified user forgets his password, then he can click on the forget password option which will be present below the login form. He can further confirm his email ID and if it’s present in the database, an email would be sent to him in order to reset his password. He can reset and change his password in this manner. After resetting the password, he would be redirected into the login page.
    b.	If the verified user wishes to change any of his personal data, he could log into his account and then select the change credentials option. He can change any of his details there without any other verification as he is already logged into his account and after changing his credentials, he would be redirected back into his change credentials page.
    c.	The user can also proceed into his home page, which is not yet developed by me.

  3.	Browser: A browser is a user who has not or will not register and he has access only to the Index page of our system. He does not have any other roles or features except for just going through the index page.
